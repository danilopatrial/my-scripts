# Scripts

This folder contains various scripts that I use on a daily basis for automating tasks, data processing, or any other routine processes I work on. These scripts are organized and can be modified or extended based on my needs.

Each module have a helper command (shown below) and also a readme file for better instructions.

```bash
python -m downloads_cleaner --help
```

- `downloads_cleaner` - Organizes and cleans files on my downloads folder.
